This is my final project for the basic C# dotnet course.
This project use EntityFrameWork of Microsoft, includes 2 packages:
 - Microsoft.EntityFrameWorkCore.Design(8.0.6)
 - Microsoft.EntityFrameWorkCore.SqlServer(8.0.6)
This project purpose is for:
 - Students to view their grades for each test of each subjects.
 - Teachers to view their teaching subjects, classes, and view, add, update Students grades for tests of each class, subjects that they're teaching.

P/s: It's pretty basic, the hardes part was using LINQ to filter out data from the database.
